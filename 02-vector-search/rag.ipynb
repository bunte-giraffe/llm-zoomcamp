       "\"There are different instructions depending on whether you are running kafka with Java or Python.\\n\\n**Java:**\\n\\nIn the project directory, run:\\n`java -cp build/libs/<jar_name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:out src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java`\\n\\nIf you have issues, make sure the `StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` is the correct server URL and that cluster key and secrets are updated in `src/main/java/org/example/Secrets.java`.\\n\\nIf you get a `kafka.errors.NoBrokersAvailable` error, your kafka broker docker container is likely not working. Use `docker ps` to confirm and then run `docker compose up -d` in the docker compose yaml file folder.\\n\\n**Python:**\\n\\nCreate a virtual environment and run `requirements.txt` in that environment.\\n\\nTo create a virtual env and install packages (run only once):\\n`python -m venv env`\\n`source env/bin/activate`\\n`pip install -r ../requirements.txt`\\n\\nTo activate it (you'll need to run it every time you need the virtual env):\\n`source env/bin/activate`\\n\\nTo deactivate it:\\n`deactivate`\\n\\nFor Windows, the path is slightly different (it's `env/Scripts/activate`).\\n\\nAlso the virtual environment should be created only to run the python file. Docker images should first all be up and running.\\n\""
